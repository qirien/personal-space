    "Time on Talaam would be different, too: days lasted longer, but a year was only about two-thirds of a year on Earth."
    "The planet was also a lot less protected from its small sun, since it was closer than Earth.  The building materials we'd brought along would help protect us from solar flares and radiation, but only if we were inside."
