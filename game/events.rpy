# This file contains the definitions for events that will be part of the 
# game.  We define when each event can happen and what label it should
# jump to.  The events themselves are split up into events-morning,
# events-afternoon, and events-evening.  So if you want to add an event, 
# first define when it happens in this file, then add the label and the 
# appropriate content in event-whatever
  

# "init python" tells renpy this whole next thing is python code.
